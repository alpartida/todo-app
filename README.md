# React To-do App

In this project, I created a React App that displays the tasks, adds new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks. These actions all touch upon the four aspects of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). I created this application during my time at Redwood Code Academy.
