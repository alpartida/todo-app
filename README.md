# React To-do App

In this project, I created a React App that displays the tasks, adds new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks. These actions all touch upon the four aspects of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete). I created this application during my time at Redwood Code Academy. 

## npm install
Installs the dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json.

## npm run start
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.
